# USE OF AI

AI was used as a tool at every stage of this project. It was primarily used in the production of documentation, starting with software requirements, in the implementation phase for code generation and the development of the frontend and backend, in debug management, in deployment processes, in writing tests, and finally in the production of deliverables files.

## Lessons learned for ai

First of all, due to the large number of requirements, there are some errors in my file because I will not implement certain features or due to incorrectly written requirements, and I cannot undo these due to the project structure. In the future, when creating documentation with AI, I will examine the files in detail.

During the implementation process, I added and removed some features, and some dead fields remained in the code. Since I didn't have time to refactor to clean up these dead fields, it resulted in some poor usage. In the future, I will also work on the refactoring process.

While writing the tests, I actually implemented them quickly using AI, but when I created the test matrix with the feature requirements, I noticed that some tests were missing and some tests were not fully addressed. At this point, I want to allocate more time for test implementation in the future and go through a proper testing process.

AI is actually a very important tool in the software development process, but sometimes we make mistakes in its use to speed things up. At every point, we should observe what AI is doing and not let go of control.
