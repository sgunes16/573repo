# What went well

While developing the project, developing a software project end-to-end was a very beneficial experience for me. I was able to improve my skills in Django on the backend. I designed a test structure for the code I wrote for the first time and understood the logic of the tests. On the frontend, I was able to validate the accuracy of the design with use cases from the customer's perspective. 

# What did not go so well

I had issues with timing. Since I didn't start with the requirements exactly right, I had to constantly update them, and when I did, they started to deviate from the structure I had initially envisioned. Additionally, I encountered problems with AI usage, so I realized that the project needed refactoring at certain points, but I couldn't keep up. I tested certain cases, but when I compared the requirements with the tests I created, I realized that I hadn't actually tested many features. I couldn't do what I wanted with GitHub, I couldn't manage my issues, the release notes were wrong, and my wiki page was messy.

# What could have we avoided?

I could have avoided using an AI tool without fully understanding it. I misused AI because I didn't manage my time properly, and although there are no problems with the project at the moment, there are unnecessary areas and functions. In other words, if I had started with the right requirements, the project wouldn't have changed so much.

# How could we do things better next time?

I would definitely get the requirements right from the start. Then I would complete all the designs upfront and create the database schema accordingly. Once the documentation was ready, the implementation process would go more smoothly. Also, when adding a feature, I would definitely add the relevant tests immediately. Otherwise, tests might be added later.
