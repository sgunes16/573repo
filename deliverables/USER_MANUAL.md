## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 What is The Hive?

**The Hive** is a community-based time banking platform where neighbors exchange skills and services using **time as currency**. Instead of paying with money, you exchange hours of service—one hour of help equals one time credit, regardless of the type of service.

### 1.2 Core Concept

- **Give an hour** → Earn 1 time credit
- **Receive an hour** → Spend 1 time credit
- All services are valued equally (1 hour = 1 credit)

### 1.3 Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Offers** | Services you can provide to others |
| **Wants** | Services you're looking for |
| **Handshake** | The exchange process between two users |
| **TimeBank** | Your personal balance of time credits |
| **Forum** | Community discussion board |
| **Map View** | Find nearby offers and wants |
